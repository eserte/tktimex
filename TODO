TODO
----

* Don't disturb the user if "last" is not available. Use is_in_path
  instead.

* "Show current project" may show the wrong project if with another
  project was chosen by right-click menu

* -readonly option for tktimex: lot to be done, but this is necessary
  to have a look at a locked file. Maybe the easiest solution: use a
  temporary copy of the .pj1 and use this. All changes would
  automatically get lost.

* Interval editor => annotation: the entry should be white. Also the
  date entries, if not yet.

* Interval editor => change of any option: window jumps if
  enlightenment wm is used (probably because I destroy the window and
  recreate it, instead of reusing the toplevel)

* Daily details: Show is not necessary, if immediately is active.
  Disable show in this case.

  Maybe move "close" button elsewhere, to bottom?

* Find a better wording for "Kein Intervall"/The breaking of the chain
  (maybe a better image, like the one from Gimp)

* Maybe make interface=medium default and should not contain stuff
  like enterprise etc. (which is not used anymore anyway)

* If there's no project file, than ask for one and ask the user if he
  wants to use it as default (so it's stored in the config) (Is this
  already implemented?)

* Is it possible to change the right-mouse popup menu behaviour to
  stay all the time? (Like in modern GUIs?)

* Stacktrace, tktimex version from approx: 02 Mar 2005:

* Auto-shrink icons if too large (by integral numbers or using the
  resizing module from cpan)

* Windows version: put tktimex into systray and remove from the
  taskbar when iconified?

  Some BASIC code:

procedure TForm1.FormCreate(Sender: TObject) ;
begin
   ShowWindow(Application.Handle, SW_HIDE) ;
   SetWindowLong(Application.Handle, GWL_EXSTYLE,
     getWindowLong(Application.Handle, GWL_EXSTYLE) or
     WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW) ;
   ShowWindow(Application.Handle, SW_SHOW) ;
end;

* The hidden ESC and bad usability: all places with
  entries/browseentries and which can only be left by hitting
  esc/return, should get additional ok/cancel buttons. Example: new
  project entry in footer.

* Tk::LongDialog should be bundled with tktimex. Maybe find some other
  Dialog calls and replace with LongDialog. And maybe put LongDialog
  to CPAN or even to Tk?

* Dialog handling: Option for changing dialog mode for input (like
  project name): "normal" for normal dialogs and "advanced"/"embedded"
  for dialogs within the footer of the toplevel (like now). Normal
  should be default.

* Implementation detail for projectlist HList: always use show/hide
  when hiding items from the list, e.g. "show archived", "hide old" ...?
  Nowadays, with fast computers, this seems to be not a problem
  anymore.

* Note: bei insert_all muss schon auf das hide-flag geachtet werden
  und nach jedem insert_project ggfs. ein hide() gemacht werden. oder
  immer nachträglich nach insert_all, wahrscheinlich leichter zu
  implementieren 

* "Continue last" from main menu does not work? Nothing happens?

* The hide algorithm should make sure that running projects (+ parents)
  are never hidden

* When searching for a project, then hidden projects should also be
  found and unhidden for this moment. Maybe more general: a project
  which has the anchor should be unhidden.

* Show daily details: also show current running project, maybe with a
  "+" sign or so to show that it's still running

* Maybe: daily details: show also annotations?

* project tree: +/- verschwindet manchmal (beim editieren der zeit)
