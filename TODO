TODO
----

* If the project list has to be redrawn (e.g. because timeformat was
  changed) then the selection (the green background) of the active
  projects gets lost

* "Show current project" may show the wrong project if with another
  project was chosen by right-click menu

* -readonly option for tktimex: lot to be done, but this is necessary
  to have a look at a locked file. Maybe the easiest solution: use a
  temporary copy of the .pj1 and use this. All changes would
  automatically get lost.

* Interval editor => annotation: the entry should be white. Also the
  date entries, if not yet.

* Interval editor => change of any option: window jumps if
  enlightenment wm is used (probably because I destroy the window and
  recreate it, instead of reusing the toplevel)

* Daily details: Show is not necessary, if immediately is active.
  Disable show in this case.

* Find a better wording for "Kein Intervall"/The breaking of the chain
  (maybe a better image, like the one from Gimp)

* Maybe make interface=medium default and should not contain stuff
  like enterprise etc. (which is not used anymore anyway)
